The faults on it are...

1. Parking sensors have not worked for a year. Apparently they flood with water and have to be drained so whenever they are fixed they only last until it rains and then they are flooded again.

2. Satnav screen reboots after crashing few times a day.

3. Auto stop/start has system fault sometimes which once meant the battery was dead and I couldn't start it again.

4. Air conditioning hasn't worked for 2 years. Compressor is leaking. On order for a new one but dealer tells me there's a huge waiting list! 

5. Bluetooth goes off randomly. Think it goes to sleep after not being used. 

6. Alarm goes off when it's hot so in the summer I leave it unlocked because it pisses me off 

7. Wireless key is dodgy. Sometimes can't find key until it's on the dash.

8. Auto dip headlights have stopped working. Back to manual.

9. Windscreen wipers auto function doesn't work. Back to manual.

10. Occasional ABS error which results in me pulling over immediately when it comes up and switching the car on and off again. Not driving a car with errors like that. Dangerous!

11. Back electric windows no longer work. Checked fuses and garage doesn't know why either.

12. Front radar which is the anti-collision detection randomly stops working.","2017-03-30T15:43:44+0000",10,29,"1363597397011754_1372357986135695","is it more reliable than the qashqai the faults on it are parking sensors have not worked for a year apparently they flood with water and have to be drained so whenever they are fixed they only last until it rains and then they are flooded again satnav screen reboots after crashing few times a day auto stop start has system fault sometimes which once meant the battery was dead and i couldn t start it again air conditioning hasn t worked for years compressor is leaking on order for a new one but dealer tells me there s a huge waiting list bluetooth goes off randomly think it goes to sleep after not being used alarm goes off when it s hot so in the summer i leave it unlocked because it pisses me off wireless key is dodgy sometimes can t find key until it s on the dash auto dip headlights have stopped working back to manual windscreen wipers auto function doesn t work back to manual occasional abs error which results in me pulling over immediately when it comes up and switching the car on and off again not driving a car with errors like that dangerous back electric windows no longer work checked fuses and garage doesn t know why either front radar which is the anti collision detection randomly stops working"

I didn't look after the car either (got regular lectures from my dad for it Ì†ΩÌπà) The 2nd was just as good. Thick snow and ice- never skidded just kept going(normal tyres) Often over taking 4x4's. I worked on a farm on the Yorkshire Moors. I needed a bigger car when I had my daughter and now have a Nissan Note which again has not had an easy life with me but again no trouble  with it at all.

I buy micras becuase it was the only car that is small enough not to big and that I cna reach the peddles in and not be to close to the wheel after moving the seat forward. I'm only 1 metre 50cm's tall and I had both 1998 and 2005 models in which I still have the 2005 model, but now needs to much repaire. Luckily I liked the size and shapes of them as they appeal to woman as well so it was a bonus. As I could not feel comfortable driving a car I did not like the shape of. The only thing I did not like about the 2005 model was the way the front bonnet slopes and cruves down, becuase being so small I could not see the front of the car as well as I could with the straighter front bonnet of the 1998 model, and the head rests on the 2005 model made your head be forced to far forwar like it was hunching you over, so my Dad got a hammer to the head bars on the rsts and bashed them backwards for me. But this car looks to male and to sporty, it's a car that woman like and now you have made it look to aggresive and mean in shape and apperance. i want a girly car so I think i'll have to look at an newer second hand model of the micra I already have becuase there is no way I'm buying this, it's ugly. but i expect  guy would say it isn't.
